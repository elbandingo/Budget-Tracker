# Budget-Tracker PWA
## Description    
This PWA (progressive web application) was built based on started code provided in the UofT virtual coding bootcamp. The purpose of the application is to create an online and offline budgeting calculator. When offline, transactions can be added and stored, and when the application is brought back online, the cached items will load into the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
